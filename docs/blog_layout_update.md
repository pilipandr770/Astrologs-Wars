# Blog Layout Update

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Shop Block (Position 12) from Blog Display**
   - Modified the `/app/blog/routes.py` file to remove the shop block append logic
   - Now only the 8 horoscope blocks (positions 1-8) are displayed in the blog

2. **Changed Blog Layout to 2 Rows of 4 Blocks**
   - Updated Bootstrap grid classes from `row-cols-lg-3` to `row-cols-lg-4`
   - Added additional responsive classes `row-cols-sm-2` for better display on medium screens
   - This ensures we get 4 blocks per row on large screens, 2 blocks per row on medium screens,
     and 1 block per row on small screens

3. **Made Blocks More Compact**
   - Reduced image height from 200px to 180px
   - Added CSS to make fonts slightly smaller and more compact
   - Added fixed height to card bodies to ensure consistent layout
   - Added overflow handling to prevent text from breaking the layout
   - Added hover effects for better user experience

4. **Added Verification Script**
   - Created `verify_blog_layout.py` to check that all 8 horoscope blocks are active
   - Script will automatically activate or create blocks if any are missing
   - Includes content preview to verify the text in each block

## Technical Notes

- The shop block at position 12 still exists in the database but is no longer displayed on the blog page
- All active horoscope blocks (positions 1-8) are now shown in a clean 4Ã—2 grid layout
- The grid is responsive and will adjust to different screen sizes
- Block titles and contents remain unchanged, only their arrangement and styling are modified

## Testing

The verification script confirms:
1. All 8 horoscope blocks (positions 1-8) are active and available
2. Each block contains the appropriate astrological content
3. HTML tags are properly stripped from summaries
