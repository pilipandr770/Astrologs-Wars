# Horoscope Generator Schedule Update

## Overview

The horoscope generator has been updated to run automatically at 3:00 AM every day, including the new ephemeris data integration. Both the Render cloud configuration and the local scheduler have been updated to use this new schedule.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `render.yaml`**:
   - Changed schedule from `"0 0 * * *"` (midnight) to `"0 3 * * *"` (3:00 AM)
   - Added `USE_EPHEMERIS_DATA` environment variable (default: true)

2. **Updated `schedule_horoscopes.py`**:
   - Changed schedule from 7:00 AM to 3:00 AM
   - Updated log messages to reflect the new schedule

3. **Updated Run Scripts**:
   - Modified all scheduler launcher scripts (`run_horoscope_scheduler.*`) to show the correct time

4. **Added Ephemeris Integration**:
   - Created robust ephemeris calculation module
   - Integrated planetary positions into horoscope prompts
   - Added environment variable control of this feature

## Testing

The integration has been tested to ensure:
- Scheduler correctly launches at the specified time
- Ephemeris data is properly calculated and included in prompts
- All components work together seamlessly

## Documentation

New documentation files have been created:

- `docs/AUTOMATIC_HOROSCOPE_GENERATION.md` - Complete guide to the automatic generation
- `docs/HOROSCOPE_SCHEDULER_UPDATE.md` - Details about the scheduler updates
- `docs/EPHEMERIS_INTEGRATION.md` - Documentation on the ephemeris feature
- `docs/EPHEMERIS_INTEGRATION_EN.md` - English version of the ephemeris documentation

## Server Deployment

After deployment to the Render platform, the cron job will automatically run at 3:00 AM server time (Frankfurt region).

If deploying to a different server, use the included `init_scheduler.sh` script to set up a systemd service that ensures the scheduler keeps running.

## Local Testing

To test locally:
```bash
# Run the ephemeris test
python test_ephemeris.py

# Run the integration test
python test_ephemeris_integration.py

# Start the scheduler (it will run at 3:00 AM)
python schedule_horoscopes.py
```

## Manual Override

If you need to generate horoscopes immediately, without waiting for the scheduled time:
```bash
python daily_horoscope_replace.py
```

This will run with all the same settings as the scheduled task.
