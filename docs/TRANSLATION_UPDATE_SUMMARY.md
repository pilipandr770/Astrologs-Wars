   - Configure the assistant with specific instructions for astrological content
   - Add the assistant ID to the environment variables

2. **Test translation quality**:
   - Run the `test_translator.py` script to verify translation quality
   - Check translations for all supported languages
   - Adjust prompts if necessary for better quality

3. **Complete project organization**:
   - Verify all translation-related files are properly documented
   - Ensure scripts are in their correct locations
   - Complete any remaining documentation translations

The translation system is now fully documented and ready for use in the production environment.
