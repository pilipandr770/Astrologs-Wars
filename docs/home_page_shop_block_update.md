# Home Page Shop Block Update

## Changes Made

1. **Replaced Online Payment Block with Shop Block**
   - Removed the old payment block at the bottom of the home page
   - Added a new shop block with product showcase and shop link
   - Ensured the shop block is consistent with the shop block in the header

2. **Updated Main Route**
   - Modified `index` route in `app/main/routes.py` to fetch featured products
   - Removed unused payment methods that were previously needed for the payment block
   - Added featured products to the template context

3. **Created Verification Script**
   - Created `verify_shop_block.py` to check if required products and settings exist
   - Added functionality to create sample products if needed

## Technical Notes

- The shop block displays the latest 3 products from the database
- Uses the same styling as the shop block that appears elsewhere in the site
- Includes multilingual support (EN, DE, RU, UK) for all text
- Clicking anywhere on the block will redirect to the shop page

## Testing

The verification script confirms that:
1. At least 3 active products exist in the database
2. The Settings object exists with necessary social media links

## Next Steps

- Visit the home page to verify the new shop block appears correctly
- Check the styling and positioning of the block
- Ensure that clicking on the shop block redirects to the shop page properly
