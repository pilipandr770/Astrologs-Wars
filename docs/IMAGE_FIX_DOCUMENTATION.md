# Image and Blog Content Fixes

This document outlines the fixes that were implemented to resolve issues with missing images and blog content in the application.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Template Error Handling**
   - Fixed `'None' has no attribute 'strftime'` errors in templates
   - Added null checks for `publish_date` in all blog templates
   - Added conditional rendering for blog post sections when no blog posts exist

2. **Missing Blog Images**
   - Fixed image paths in templates with fallback handling
   - Applied `onerror` fallback in templates to check both path variations
   - Set up proper directory structure for blog images

3. **Missing Product Images**
   - Created placeholder images for all missing product images
   - Ensured proper image handling in product templates

## Files Modified

1. **Templates:**
   - `app/templates/index.html`: Added null checks for blog post date display
   - `app/templates/blog/index.html`: Fixed date display and image paths
   - `app/templates/blog/post_detail.html`: Fixed date display and related posts

2. **Scripts Created:**
   - `check_images_and_db.py`: Detects missing images and database inconsistencies
   - `fix_all_images.py`: Attempts to restore images from backup locations
   - `create_placeholder_images.py`: Creates placeholder images for missing product images

## Directory Structure

- Blog images should be stored in: `app/static/uploads/blog/`
- Product images should be stored in: `app/static/uploads/`

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Image Handling:**
   - Always validate image references before displaying them
   - Use fallback mechanisms for missing images
   - Store only the filename in the database, not the full path

2. **Date Handling:**
   - Always check for null dates before calling `strftime()`
   - Use a default or empty string when date is null

3. **Database Consistency:**
   - Run periodic checks to ensure all referenced images exist
   - Create backups of uploaded images regularly

## Testing

After implementing these fixes, all the following issues were resolved:
- Blog admin routes now work correctly
- Blog posts display with proper images
- No 404 errors for images
- No template errors due to null date values
