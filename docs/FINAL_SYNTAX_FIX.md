# Final Syntax Fix Documentation

## Background
In the process of updating the astrology website, we identified one remaining syntax error that needed to be fixed to ensure successful deployment on Render.

## Issue
In the file `app/blog/routes.py`, line 95 contained a syntax error where a Cyrillic character was used instead of English:

```python
for position в range(1, 13):
```

The Cyrillic letter "в" was used instead of the English word "in".

## Solution
- Replaced the Cyrillic letter "в" with the English word "in"
- Verified no other similar syntax errors existed in the codebase

## Benefits
- Fixed the last remaining syntax error preventing deployment on Render
- Ensured proper execution of the admin dashboard function for blog blocks
- Completed the final step in our deployment preparation checklist

## Testing
After implementing this change, the website should deploy successfully on Render without any syntax errors.
