# Layout and Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. Language Switcher Not Working
- **Problem**: Language selection dropdown wasn't triggering form submission
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `onchange="this.form.submit()"` to the language selector
  - Added a hidden field `lang_switch` to improve form detection
  - Ensured action and method are properly specified

### 2. Fixed Header and Footer Not Consistently Applied
- **Problem**: Header and footer weren't consistently fixed at the top and bottom across all pages
- **Solutions**:
  - Added explicit fixed positioning for both header and footer with `position: fixed !important`
  - Increased z-index to 9000 to ensure they appear above other elements
  - Added padding to the body element to prevent content from being hidden under the header and footer
  - Created cross-browser compatibility fixes for iOS Safari and other browsers
  - Added CSS rules to ensure proper stacking context of elements

### 3. Footer Not Visible on Home Page and Blog Pages
- **Problem**: The footer was only visible on the shop pages but hidden on other pages
- **Solutions**:
  - Added `!important` directives to visibility, display, and z-index properties
  - Fixed margin and padding on relevant containers
  - Added specific CSS rules to ensure footer visibility on all page types

### 4. Chat Widget Always Open Instead of Hidden by Default
- **Problem**: The chat widget was always visible and open instead of being hidden until clicked
- **Solutions**:
  - Removed forced display and visibility styles that were keeping it open
  - Set `display: none` on the chat window element to hide it by default
  - Added additional JavaScript to ensure proper toggling behavior
  - Made sure the chat button remains visible while the chat window is hidden by default

### 4. Home Page Template Reference Issue
- **Problem**: The main routes.py was referencing 'index.html.new' instead of 'index.html'
- **Solution**: Updated the template reference to use 'index.html'

## Technical Changes:

1. **Base.html Updates**:
   - Fixed language switcher form to properly submit on change
   - Added explicit fixed positioning for header with inline styles 
   - Increased z-index of header and footer to 9000
   - Added padding to body element to accommodate fixed elements
   - Added inline visibility and z-index styles to chat widget elements

2. **CSS Updates**:
   - Enhanced footer_fix.css with proper z-index and visibility rules
   - Created new fixed_position_fix.css for cross-browser compatibility
   - Modified style.css to ensure consistent z-index hierarchy
   - Added specific fixes for blog pages to ensure footer visibility
   - Added mobile-specific adjustments for better responsiveness

3. **Template Reference**:
   - Updated main/routes.py to use the correct template (index.html)

4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
   - Added CSS fixes for iOS Safari issues with fixed positioning
   - Used transform and backface-visibility properties for better rendering
   - Ensured overflow handling to prevent scrolling issues

## How to Verify the Fixes:

1. **Language Switching**: Select a different language from the dropdown menu on any page. The page should reload with content in the selected language.

2. **Footer Visibility**: Navigate to different sections of the site (Home, Blog, Shop). The footer should be visible at the bottom of each page.

3. **Chat Widget**: The chat button should be visible on all pages in the bottom right corner.

These fixes maintain the fixed position of both the header and footer while ensuring proper visibility and functionality across all pages of the site.
