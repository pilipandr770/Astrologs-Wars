# Blog Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **HTML Tags in Blog Summaries**
   - Problem: Raw HTML tags were being displayed in the blog summaries
   - Solution: 
     - Created text_utils.py with strip_html_tags function to clean HTML
     - Updated get_blog_block_summary function to strip HTML tags
     - Removed the `|safe` filter from the template

2. **Only 6 Blocks Showing Instead of 8**
   - Problem: Blog page was not showing all 8 horoscope blocks
   - Solution:
     - Modified blog index route to specifically fetch only the 8 horoscope blocks (positions 1-8)
     - Added check_horoscope_blocks.py script to ensure all 8 are active
     - Fixed the display logic to properly show all 8 horoscope blocks

3. **Added Shop Block at Bottom**
   - Problem: No shop block was present at the bottom of the blog page
   - Solution:
     - Created setup_shop_block.py script to ensure position 12 has a shop block
     - Modified blog index route to append the shop block (position 12) after the horoscope blocks

4. **Duplicate Template Files**
   - Problem: Duplicate templates could cause confusion
   - Solution:
     - Identified and deleted duplicate files:
       - app/templates/blog/index_new.html
       - app/templates/index.html.new

## Verification
- Successfully verified that 8 active horoscope blocks exist (positions 1-8)
- Confirmed shop block exists and is active (position 12)
- Tested HTML stripping functionality and confirmed it works properly
- Verified no duplicate templates remain

## Technical Details
- Added utility function strip_html_tags in app/utils/text_utils.py to cleanly remove HTML from text
- Updated blog routes to handle proper filtering of positions 1-8 and append position 12
- Created verification script to confirm all fixes are working properly
