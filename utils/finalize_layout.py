===================

The following changes were made to restore fixed header and footer while ensuring visibility on all pages:

1. Header and Footer Setup:
   - Restored position:fixed for both header and footer in base.html and style.css
   - Added z-index:1000 to ensure they appear above other content
   - Set footer background and shadow for better visibility

2. Content Spacing:
   - Added padding-top: 70px to main content to account for fixed header
   - Added padding-bottom: 80px to prevent content from being hidden by the footer
   - Set min-height to ensure proper page layout

3. Blog-Specific Fixes:
   - Added margin-bottom to blog sections, containers, and detail content
   - Added padding-bottom to ensure blog content doesn't get hidden by the footer

4. Mobile Responsiveness:
   - Added media queries for better display on mobile devices
   - Increased padding and margins for smaller screens

5. Chat Widget:
   - Adjusted chat widget position to avoid overlapping with the footer

All these changes ensure that:
1. The header remains fixed at the top of the page
2. The footer remains fixed at the bottom of the page
3. All content is visible without being hidden by the header or footer
4. The chat widget is properly positioned

The footer now displays the following links on all pages:
- Політика конфіденційності (Privacy Policy)
- Імпресум (Impressum)
- Контакти (Contacts)
